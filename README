Code to simulate habituation of a system defined as a set of ODEs in response to a square-wave input and calculate relevant properties like habituation time (ht) and recovery time (rt). Specific systems with appropriate parameter sets are also provided.

Note: in the receptor_feedforward.ipynb and receptor_Ra.ipynb the variables R and Ri are named in reverse than in the paper.
