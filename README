Code to reproduce the simulations and figures in the following paper:

Biochemically plausible models of habituation for single cell learning.
Lina Eckert, Maria Sol Vidal-Saez, Ziyuan Zhao, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo, Rosa Martinez-Corral and Jeremy Gunawardena.
Current Biology, 34, 1-13. 2024. 

The code allows to simulate habituation of a system defined as a set of ODEs in response to a square-wave input and calculate relevant properties like habituation time (ht) and recovery time (rt). Specific systems with appropriate parameter sets are also provided.
All figure papers can be reproduced from the notebook paper_figures_all.
There is also the code to reproduce the models originally proposed by Staddon, as we discuss in the paper.
