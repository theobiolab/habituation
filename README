Code to reproduce the simulations and figures in the paper "Learning in single cells: biochemically-plausible models of habituation" by Lina Eckert, Maria Sol Vidal, Ziyuan Zhao, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo, Rosa Martinez-Corral and Jeremy Gunawardena. 

Once the paper is published the reference will be added. 

The code allows to simulate habituation of a system defined as a set of ODEs in response to a square-wave input and calculate relevant properties like habituation time (ht) and recovery time (rt). Specific systems with appropriate parameter sets are also provided.

Note: in the receptor_feedforward.ipynb and receptor_Ra.ipynb the variables R and Ri are named in reverse than in the paper.
